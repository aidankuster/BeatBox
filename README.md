Developed by Aidan Kuster with additional help from Mikul Brimley and Daniel Vivar.

- BeatBox is a drum machine application that allows users to create drum beats and rhythmic patterns.
- Users can program beats into the “sequencer” or can play drums live using their computer keyboard.
- Provides two different drum machine sound presets (TR-808 & TR-909) and the ability to change the speed of the drum pattern (BPM value).
